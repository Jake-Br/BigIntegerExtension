This project illustrates extending BigInteger to include functionality for Sine
operations to be performed with BigIntegers.

We use .NET 5.0 BigInteger struct, so you need the .NET 5.0 SDK.  This project has been
successfully built on Linux using the dotnet binary installed MANUALLY and Visual Studio Code.  
It has also been successfully built using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition with .NET 5.0 SDK. 

Only the files in src/ are cross-platform compatible.  You should use the src/ files as a starting point
to create a new project in your build OS and IDE of choice.
